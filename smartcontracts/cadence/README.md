## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flow CLI installed
  ```
  brew install flow-cli  # (on Mac)
  ```
  
  For other platforms: https://docs.onflow.org/flow-cli/install/

### Setup

1. Initialize the Flow project (if not already initialized):
   ```
   flow init
   ```

2. Update the `flow.json` file with your account information:
   - Replace "0x01cf0e2f2f715450" with your deployed contract address
   - Replace "YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY" with your private key if deploying from CLI
   - Update deployments to use your actual Flow account name

### Deployment

#### Local Emulator

Start the Flow emulator:
```
flow emulator
```

Deploy to the emulator:
```
flow project deploy --network emulator
```

#### Testing

To run a transaction (deposit stablecoin):
```
flow transactions send ./transactions/deposit_stablecoin.cdc --args-json '[{"type": "UFix64", "value": "100.0"}]' --signer admin
```

To run a script (get user balance):
```
flow scripts execute ./scripts/get_user_balance.cdc --args-json '[{"type": "Address", "value": "0x01cf0e2f2f715450"}]'
```

## Testnet/Mainnet Deployment

Update the account address in `flow.json` before deploying to testnet or mainnet.
