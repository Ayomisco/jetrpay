🚀 JetrPay Development Roadmap (with Smart Contracts Focus)
🔷 1. 🧠 Project Overview
Project Name:

JetrPay

One-liner:

A stablecoin-powered onramp, offramp, and crypto payment infrastructure for individuals and businesses in Africa and emerging markets.JetrPay is a stablecoin-powered on-ramp and payment infrastructure for individuals and businesses in Africa and emerging markets — enabling instant buy, sell, accept, and swap of stablecoins like USDC via local fiat payment methods. 🧠 Project Description JetrPay is building a crypto-fiat bridge for the real world — starting in Africa. We’re solving broken remittance systems, expensive FX conversions, and crypto usability barriers by creating a flow-powered, non-custodial platform for: Buying stablecoins with fiat (card, bank, mobile money) Withdrawing to bank accounts or mobile wallets Accepting crypto payments for merchants Enabling asset swaps (e.g., USDC → FLOW, ETH, SOL) Simple integration for dApps and developers (Post-MVP) All designed with speed, trust, simplicity, and mobile-first UX at the core.




🔷 2. 🌍 Key Objectives
Problem	JetrPay Solution
Expensive, slow FX & remittance	Instant stablecoin (USDC.e) transfers
Limited access to crypto in Africa	Fiat onramp via cards, bank, mobile money
Merchant crypto payments are hard	Easy P2P and P2B stablecoin transactions
Users lack technical knowledge	Walletless onboarding and simple UX
Manual crypto operations	Forte automation via Agents and Actions
🔷 3. 🎯 Core Features (MVP Scope)
Feature Category	Feature
Onboarding	Email/social login, KYC with SmileID
Fiat Onramp	Deposit via Paystack/Flutterwave to buy USDC
Stablecoin Wallet	Send, receive, check balance (USDC.e on Flow)
Payments	Pay merchants or friends via QR/code
Offramp	Withdraw USDC to Naira bank or mobile money
Automation	Subscriptions, auto-top-ups (via Forte)
Swaps (Later)	USDC ↔ FLOW, ETH, SOL (via Increment.fi / Axelar)
🔷 4. 🧭 User Journey Flow

🔷 7. 🧱 Smart Contract Development Plan
Phase 1: Basic Token Management (USDC Vault)
Task	Description
USDCVault.cdc	Manages user balances, deposits, and withdrawals
mint_usdc.cdc	Only backend/admin can mint USDC on user deposit
burn_usdc.cdc	Burn USDC on fiat withdrawal
transfer_usdc.cdc	P2P transfer logic
Phase 2: Payment Flows
Task	Description
pay_merchant.cdc	Send USDC to merchant wallet
send_peer.cdc	Normal user-to-user transfers
IPaymentAction.cdc	Standard interface for Actions
Phase 3: Forte Automation (Actions & Agents)
Task	Description
ForteActions.cdc	Custom Cadence actions (e.g. SplitPayment, SchedulePay)
create_action.cdc	Create reusable action logic
execute_action.cdc	Call action when triggered
ForteAgents.cdc	Monitor rules, recurring logic
create_agent.cdc	Set up auto-pay, top-ups
