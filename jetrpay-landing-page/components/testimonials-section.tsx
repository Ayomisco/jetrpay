    text: "I am usually not a fan of online loan or microfinance apps. But it feels surreal to find an app that can connect a borrower (like me) to potential lenders. I like how the Kredete app makes many things easy at a time. I can save, make USD transactions and still get an online card too‚Ä¶ wow!!! I love this innovation‚Ä¶ feels like something that should work only in the US‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs already working here in Nigeria. Lovely to see!"

I‚Äôve been hoping that a platform that can help me build my credit score and secure a wider range of loans could be created and I‚Äôm glad Kredete came just at the right time. Okayyy, so I can now run my business with more loan opportunities. It‚Äôs a great stuff all the wayyyy!!!"
